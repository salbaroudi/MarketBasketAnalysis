    "CT | B | $\\bar{B}$ | Marg(A)\n",

    "**A** | f$_{11}$ | f$_{10}$ | f$_{1+}$\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Example 2 (underestimate): $\\{Tea\\} \\rightarrow \\{Honey\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "CT | Honey | $\\bar{Honey}$ | Marg(A)\n",
    "--- | --- | --- | ---\n",

Since support is just a measure of probability an itemset occurs in a sample, we can define this in terms of support: $s_{\\perp} = s(A)s(B)$.
